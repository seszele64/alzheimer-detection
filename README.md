**Alzheimer's Disease Stage Detection Using Deep Learning**

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model designed to detect various stages of Alzheimer's disease using MRI brain scans. The project employs a transfer learning approach, utilizing the EfficientNetB0 architecture, adapted to classify images into four distinct stages: nondemented, very mild, mild, and moderate dementia. Built with PyTorch, the model is trained on a structured dataset of MRI images and provides a robust framework for early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s progression.

### Key Features:
- **Model Architecture:** Utilizes the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model, fine-tuned for the specific task of classifying Alzheimer's disease stages from brain MRIs.
- **Data Processing:** Includes comprehensive preprocessing and augmentation techniques to optimize model training and performance.
- **API Integration:** Features a Flask-based REST API that enables users to upload MRI images and receive diagnostic predictions, facilitating easy interaction with the model.
- **Containerization:** Docker support for easy setup and deployment, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Implements various metrics for thorough evaluation and validation of the model, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.

### Project Structure:
- `/model`: Contains the model definitions and state.
- `/data`: Dataset directory with train and test splits.
- `/utils`: Utility functions for data loading and transformations.
