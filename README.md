**Alzheimer's Disease Stage Detection Using Deep Learning**

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model designed to detect various stages of Alzheimer's disease using MRI brain scans. The project employs a transfer learning approach, utilizing the EfficientNetB0 architecture, adapted to classify images into four distinct stages: nondemented, very mild, mild, and moderate dementia. Built with PyTorch, the model is trained on a structured dataset of MRI images and provides a robust framework for early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s progression.

### Key Features:

- **Model Architecture:** Utilizes the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model, fine-tuned for the specific task of classifying Alzheimer's disease stages from brain MRIs.
- **Data Processing:** Includes comprehensive preprocessing and augmentation techniques to optimize model training and performance.
- **API Integration:** Features a Flask-based REST API that enables users to upload MRI images and receive diagnostic predictions, facilitating easy interaction with the model.
- **Containerization:** Docker support for easy setup and deployment, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Implements various metrics for thorough evaluation and validation of the model, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.

### Project Structure:

- `/model`: Contains the model definitions and state.
- `/data`: Dataset directory with train and test splits.
- `/utils`: Utility functions for data loading and transformations.
- `/api`: Contains the Flask application for the REST API.
- `/tests/`: Includes test scripts
- `train.py`: Script for model training.
- `evaluate.py`: Script for model evaluation and performance metrics.

### Goals:

- To provide a reliable tool for early detection of Alzheimer's disease stages, aiding in better management and treatment planning.
- To contribute to the ongoing research in medical AI by demonstrating the application of advanced machine learning techniques in healthcare diagnostics.
- To offer an accessible platform for further development and validation by the research community, healthcare professionals, and technology enthusiasts.

## Usage:

1. Train the model using **`train.py`**.
2. Evaluate the model's performance with **`evaluate.py`**.
